# 🎮 VR Simple Game Project 🌌

This project serves as a foundational demonstration of Virtual Reality (VR) development principles. It's a basic VR game developed to showcase fundamental VR mechanics and introduce users to an immersive digital environment.

## 📝 Project Description

This is "A basic Virtual Reality game developed using Unity and C#, demonstrating fundamental VR mechanics." It's a project designed to explore and implement core concepts within VR development.

## ✨ Features

* **Fundamental VR Mechanics**: Implements basic VR interactions and player control within a virtual space.
* **Simple Virtual Environment**: Provides a navigable 3D environment for exploration.
* **Demonstrative Purpose**: Created to highlight foundational VR development skills and concepts.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Unity**: The primary game engine used for development.
* **C#**: The programming language for game logic and scripting within Unity.
* **VR Development**: General knowledge and application of VR development principles and SDKs.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

To get this project running on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BeshoyAziz7/VR-Simple-Game-Project.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd VR-Simple-Game-Project
    ```
3.  **Open in Unity**:
    * Launch Unity Hub and open the cloned project. Ensure you have a Unity version compatible with VR development (e.g., Unity 2021.x or newer).
    * Make sure your Unity project has the necessary XR Plug-in Management (e.g., OpenXR, Oculus, SteamVR) configured for your target VR headset.

## 🎮 How to Play / Usage

Once the project is opened in Unity and configured for your VR setup:

1.  **Build and Run**: Build the project for your specific VR platform (e.g., Oculus Quest, PC VR).
2.  **Explore**: Put on your VR headset and navigate the simple environment.
3.  **Interact**: Experience the fundamental VR mechanics demonstrated in the project.
